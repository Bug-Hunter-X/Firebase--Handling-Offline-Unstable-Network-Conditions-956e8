This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Firebase SDK: handling situations where the device is offline or has an unstable network connection.  The `bug.js` file showcases code that fails silently when offline.  `bugSolution.js` provides a robust solution using Firebase's offline capabilities and proper error handling.
